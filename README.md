# BRONJ-Clinical-Data-Analysis
Synthetic dataset of 46 cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates, half developing BRONJ. Data include demographics, medications, and genetic SNPs. Analysis with SQLite, pandas, and statistical tests (chi2, t-test) shows SNP1, and its combination with SNP2, associated with BRONJ risk.
